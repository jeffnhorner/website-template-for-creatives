# A Photographer's dream website

Welcome! 

This repo is a simple frontend codebase website for a photographer (feel free to repuporse it for any profession). I built it for my wife but we've decided to go in a different direction. It's not quite complete and needs a decent amount of refactoring in the main style.css file (in my opinion) but all the heavy lifting is basically finished. Feel free to customize it however you choose. 

Please note, I created a template.html file that gives you a good starting place for any new pages you'd like to build/customize.

With all that said, although I won't be pushing this to production, I don't want it to go to waste! Please follow these next steps to get the project on your local computer:


### Step 1
First thing first, fork the repo to your github account. 

### Step 2
Now, you'll want to clone or download the repo to your local machine. To get the repo link, click on the green 'Clone or download' button on your fork.

Download is pretty self-explanatory. 

To clone the repo, navigate to the folder you'd like to clone the repo on your local machine and type/copy the following command: 

```html
git clone REPO_URL
```


## You're All Set!

If you end up using this template to create a website and push it live, I'd love to see the final product! Feel free to DM me on Instagram or Twitter or shoot me an email. 

# Happy Coding!
